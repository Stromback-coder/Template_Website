    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>If you’re taking this class, chances are you are a serious or at least a semi-serious UWH player or official. You have also probably been to a few tournaments, witnessing a few “bad” calls and tense moments in the pool. You may have been an angry player, a frustrated referee or a flustered new player unsure of what’s happening. No matter your level of playing experience or level of UWH knowledge, learning to referee will benefit the sport of UWH and even your game.</p>
    <h1>Player and Water Referees</h1>
    <p>Player and Water Referees
      1.	Purpose of Player Referees – Pull from Training Plan & Hand Out doc
      Player referees assist a tournament referee program by providing service as a volunteer water referee. They are responsible for assisting higher level referees. Player referees oversee play in the water and alert the referees on deck.

      2.	What is required before taking this course – Pull from Training Plan
      Successful completion of online course covering UWH fouls and ref positioning

      3.	Overview of the referee levels - Pull from Training Plan

      4.	Expectations of Player Referees - Pull from Training Plan
      Player referees must ref games in the water to assist higher level referees. Sometimes, player referees will be expected to be timekeepers and scorekeepers.  All players expecting to compete in a National Tournament should have this certification.  The certification includes successful completion of online course covering UWH fouls and ref positioning.</p>

    <h2>Level 1 Referees</h2>
    <p>1.	Purpose of Level 1 Referees
To assist a tournament referee program by providing service as either a volunteer ref or dedicated referee.

2.	What is required before taking this course
USOA member, UWH club member, successful player ref course completed. At least 5 games as water referee. A recommendation of 1 evaluator to the Player Ref quality standards.

3.	Expectations of Level 1 Referees
As a water referee, make calls and keep the game in control.  As a deck referee, manage the game operations and lead the water referees and deck staff.</p>

    <h3>Fouls and Signals</h3>
    False Start and Encroachment
Description
False Start – When one or more players leave the starting point prior to the start signal- Also, if one or more players do not have their hand on the wall when the start signal activates, the player must touch the wall prior to charging the puck.

Encroachment- there are three different game scenarios that define encroachment listed below.

1.	 On advantage puck:  When one or more players on the offending team cross the referee line prior to a defending player taking possession of the puck
Also, if the defending player does not take possession of the puck within 5 seconds, this signal is also used.
2.	On equal puck:  When any player has entire head submerged before the start signal activates.
3.	On penalty shot: When the defending player removes his/her hand from the wall while submerging- When one or both of the offending players take possession of the puck prior to the start signal - When the offending players take more than 5 seconds to take possession of the puck
Common Examples
1.	One or more players do not have their hand on the walls of their respective team end lines when start signal activates. This applies to start of match, half time, after a goal is scored and after a penalty shot has been played.
2.	A player who starts from the sub box without first touching the wall before the puck is in-play
3.	A player who leaves penalty box incorrectly, even if full time has been served-A time-penalized player shall re-enter the play by sliding feet first from sitting position into the water at the center line.
Referee Actions
If you see a false start, apply advantage rule until the puck is in play.  If the team that committed the foul manages to get the puck first, stop the game and give advantage to the other team.  If the other team got to the puck first, let the game play on.  The chief referee will direct his or hand toward the infringing team and the non-offending team will have the advantage puck. This foul usually happens accidentally.  When the foul affects the game, stop the game and award advantage puck.  If this foul occurs repeatedly, or it appears that a team doesn’t understand what they are doing, issue a team warning.

The two water referees first align themselves on the puck, then hold up one hand in a “stop” signal with the palm facing the infringing team to indicate an advantage puck; they swim 3 meters from the puck towards the infringing team and form an imaginary line across the width of the playing area behind which all players on the infringing team must retreat. If the infringing team fails to retreat or stay behind the three-meter line prior to the re-start of the play, then as a further penalty, the puck may be advanced and addition three meters towards the infringing team’s goal.
Can we use a graphic for this?
Potential Penalties
Apply advantage rule for false start
Illegal Entry of a time-penalized player incurs a one-minute time penalty

Illegal Substitution
Description
Illegal Substitution-occurs when one or more players violate the rules for substitution below

1.	Only six players are allowed outside the sub box whilst the match is in play
2.  Substitutes from each team shall be in the team’s designated substitution area; and any penalized players shall be in the designated penalty box.
3. The player who is subbing out must break the water surface in the sub box before the player they are subbing for can leave the sub box and enter the game.
4.   Players in the sub box must have snorkels and top of heads out of the water, when game is in play.
5. Free subbing is allowed after a goal, meaning subs don’t have to wait for the players they are entering play for.
6. Free subbing is also allowed after a substitute enters the water to replace a player sent out of the water for a time penalty or one who has been dismissed for the rest of the match.

Common Examples
1.	A player in the sub box who drops to the bottom of the pool for a better view of the game.
2.	New players unfamiliar with rules leaving the sub box before incoming player breaks water surface
3.	A player who gets out of the sub box without notification of chief referee

Referee Actions
Many new players at lower level tournament sub incorrectly. Call the foul if you see this repeated often.

Potential Penalties
If team subs incorrectly, the team has a minute time penalty


Dangerous Play and Headshots
Description
Dangerous play-is any play that puts others at a risk of injury, including unsportsmanlike conduct, professional fouls, and headshots

Unsportsmanlike Conduct-includes fighting, yelling, regardless of the situation, regardless of the source of aggression- It could be shown against opponents, teammates, referees, coaches and spectators.

Common Examples
1.	Obstructing an opponent in any way whilst not in possession of the puck
2.	Behaving in any way or displaying conduct that in the opinion of officials can be considered contrary to the sportsmanlike conduct of the match
3.	Removing or attempting to remove an opponents’ equipment
4.	Insulting by word or gesture
5.	Refusing to accept decisions made by the officials
6.	Physically attacking or deliberately hurting an opponent or striking or attempting to strike an opponent with any part of the bod or equipment. This includes any action in retaliation
7.	Removing the puck from the goal
8.	A player throwing his or her stick out of the pool to express anger
9.	Launching the puck from the slope of the pool from shallow end of pool to deeper end and vis versa
10.	Launching the puck into a crowd of players without intended target

Professional Fouls – any intentionally or deliberately committed fouls by players that are intended to slow down, pester, annoy, or injure and opponent.  Professional fouls are often committed at the bottom of the pool and other locations refs are least likely to see.

Common Examples
1.	A player playing a puck after a goal has been made.
2.	A player playing a puck after the “stop-game” signal has gone off.
3.	A player using the wrong color stick.
4.	A player not using proper equipment or proper player identification
5.	Pushing off the shoulder of an opponent, and stealing the puck; pinching;
6.	 Free-arm elbow to the rib-cage
7.	 Launching off another player to get to the surface.


Headshot- a direct shot the head, whether it hits the mask, snorkel, ear caps, neck, skin or chin- A headshot can be considered if the puck hits the opponent’s head, comes near it, or ricochets off the defenders stick toward the head.

Threatening shot – Sometimes an offensive player will fake a shot or take a “practice swing” causing the defender to flinch or refocus attention to protecting from injury.  The intention of dangerous play is also considered to be Dangerous Play.

Stick Foul-

Referee Actions
Water Referees should call any intentional foul that is a detriment to the safety of others. If the foul appears to be accidental, water referees shouldn’t stop the game unless someone appears hurt.
If there are signs of injury, referees should stop the game, and check on the player.  If there is any noticeable damage to the player (bleeding, confusion, dizziness), the player needs to get out of the water.  If it’s severe enough, a water referee or teammate can escort them to a safe point in the pool where first aid can be provided.  Once the player is determined to be ok, or removed from the pool, a water ref should determine the proper penalty.

Potential Penalties
1.  If the shot looked to be malicious or purposely shot, a two- or five-minute penalty should be applied.
2. If it was carelessness, or because the player “wasn’t thinking”, a two-minute penalty should be applied.
3. If it appeared to be unintentional (such as a ricochet, self-infliction, or a faulty knock down), then an advantage puck may be all that is necessary.
4. The penalty should be applied according to the nature of the offense, not the severity of injury.
5. An attempted head shot that made the would-be-receiver duck, flinch or take evasive maneuvers should be considered a Head Shot.

Grabbing the Barrier
Description
Grabbing the Barrier- when a player grabs the top of the barrier
Get a graphic so we know what the barrier is
Common Examples
1.	A player holding the barrier during a scrum alongside the wall
2.	A player holding the top of the goal during a scrum near the goal
3.	A player holding the barrier to maintain position while watching a scrum 2 meters behind the scrum.
4.	NOT A FOUL:  A player who lays a flat hand across the top of the barrier.  However, the instant the fingers curl, a foul is being committed.
5.	NOT A FOUL:  A player who lays a hand flat against the vertical surface of the barrier (or wall).  Players are permitted to push against vertical barriers.

Referee Actions
Many new players do not see barriers until their first tournament. Call if you feel it becomes a repeated offense at lower level tournaments. If multiple players do this on the same team, issue a team warning.

Potential Penalties

Out of Bounds
Description
Out of Bounds- the puck is knocked past the court boundary lines, including over or under the barriers)

Common Examples
1.	A puck getting stuck under the matting of a sport court
2.	A player using the all or barrier as a playing surface for the puck
3.	A player with a black stick makes a pass to a teammate, but an opponent attempting to block the pass manages to knock it out of bounds. Foul is on the white team.
4.	A shot at the goal is made, and the puck deflects from the goal back and falls behind the goal
5.	A scrum happens at the edge of the wall. Suddenly, the puck flips up and goes over the barrier.

Referee Actions
The out of bounds rule is usually violated accidentally and is generally understood well by players.  The only confusion players seem to have regarding this rule is when they decide to play the puck on the vertical surface of the wall.  Many pools have a rounded corner between the wall and the floor which makes it easy to get the puck on the wall.  Since the wall is not a playing surface, it is therefore Out-of-Bounds when on the wall

Potential Penalties
1.	If a player flicks the puck out of bounds, the water referee will award the advantage puck to the nonoffending team.
2.	If the stick or body of an opponent deflects puck after it has been flicked and then goes out of bounds, this will not be considered a delay of game infringement.
3.	If a puck is deflected by the stick or body of a teammate after it has been flicked, and then goes out of bounds, this will not be considered a delay of game infringement unless, in the opinion of the referee, the deflection was an intentional maneuver to stall or delay the game.
4.	 In the case of such an intentional deflection, if the offending team has already received a team caution for the offense, the player who deflected the puck out of bounds shall have a 1-minute time penalty awarded against them, while the player who flicked the puck shall not receive a penalty.
5.	If one or more players from the offending team are serving penalty time at the time the puck is deflected out of bounds, the referee may be permitted to assume that the out of bounds deflection was an intentional delay-of-game maneuver.
Examples
a) A puck getting stuck under the matting of a sport court
b) A player using the wall or barrier as a playing surface for the puck
c) A player with a black stick makes a pass to a teammate, but an opponent attempting block the pass manages to knock it out of bounds.  Foul is on white team
d) A shot a goal is made, and the puck deflects from the goal back and falls behind the goal
e) A scrum happens at the edge of the wall. Suddenly, the puck flips up and goes over the       barrier.  The referee can’t identify which team committed the foul.  It will be called Equal Puck.
6.	 White team is obviously delaying the game, taking advantage of any time-wasting event.  A defender from the black team moves forward to capture the puck, and the player in possession conveniently moves the puck out of bounds.  Not only is the foul called on the white team, but the offending player may receive a warning, team warning, or a 1-minute penalty.
7.	White stick is maneuvering a puck down the side boundary.  Black stick hits the white stick and puck goes out of bounds.  A Stick Foul is called on the black team.  Although the white stick was in possession of the puck when it went out of bounds, the stick foul preceded the out of bounds fouls.


Delay of Game and Corner Rule
Description
Delay of Game-play that is meant to delay or stall or has the effect of delaying or stalling the game

Corner Rule- when a player moves the puck to the corner, either that player, or a succeeding teammate taking possession of the puck, must move it past the 1-meter corner radius or relinquish possession.

Referee Actions
When the puck moves into a corner, there must be a ref already there.
Watch as puck moves toward the corner
Referee in corner is watching for corner rule, stick fouls, illegal advancement.
The other two referees are watching for obstructions

The water referee determines that a game is being delayed, he or she will call the foul that was committed, issue a warning, advantage, or time penalty within the limits of their duties.  Although the foul is called Delay of Game, the signal for the foul is only used when players are not abiding by the Corner Rule.





























The marked arc belongs to the corner, and once the puck makes contact with the arc the corner rule is invoked. 16.2.2 The "corner"is defined as that part of the playing area bounded by the side and end walls (or side and end lines) and a circular arc of 1-metre radius whose center is at the intersection (or projected intersection in the case of a curved corner) of the side and end walls (or side and end lines).

Potential Penalties:  Warnings, advantage or time penalties may be called for delay of game infringements.




Free Arm
Description
Free Arm Rule-the free arm is the arm that doesn’t hold the hockey stick. A player can only use their free arm for maneuvering themselves around. The free hand may not be used to support the stick, stick hand, or arm while in possession of the puck.

Common Examples
1.	A player changes direction and uses his free arm to maneuver around.  He accidentally pulls the mask off of another player.  It doesn’t matter if the other player was an opponent or a teammate.  It’s still a foul.  If it was indeed a teammate, it’s unlikely that a referee would call it, but they can.
2.	A player in possession of the puck uses the elbow of his free arm to slow down an opponent that is swimming parallel to him.
3.	A player uses his free hand to launch himself off the shoulder of an opponent who is in possession of the puck and then successfully steals the puck.
4.	A player grabbing the wrist of an opponent’s stick arm, or any other body part or equipment
5.	A player swimming with both hands on the stick is not a foul.  However, if the stick touches the puck with both hands on it, then it’s a Free Arm Foul.
6.	The free arm cannot be used to push defenders away from the puck, nor can it be used to gain   access to the puck.

Referee Actions


Potential Penalties



Obstruction (Barging, Shepherding, Blocking)

Description
The Obstruction Foul- can be committed by either an offender or defender in the game- There are three classifications of obstruction that are used:
Barging - For offender, when a player in possession of the puck runs into player(s) while advancing the puck-  For defender, when a defender runs into a player who has possession of the puck and impedes their advancement
Shepherding (aka screening) – When a player on the offensive team is too close to the teammate who is in possession of the puck, causing the puck to be inaccessible.
Blocking – Any attempt to prevent the motion or progress of another player or to prevent the puck from being accessible

Common Examples:
1. Covering or obstructing the puck with any part of the body or equipment, while not in possession of the puck, to prevent access to the puck by other players
2. Using a 'locked' free-arm to keep another player away from the puck, or by pulling the puck back behind the body whilst advancing forward and using the body to `push' another player out of the way when they are attempting to gain access to the puck
3. Curling whilst in possession of the puck, or simply pulling the puck back under the body when an individual is stationary is not deemed to be obstruction so long as the puck remains on a player's stick.
4. Using hands, arms, or body in any way to grasp, pull, or push an opponent or his/her stick
5.   A player in possession of the puck moves forward on a break-away and runs head-first into an opponent who is stationary.  The player in possession is at fault because there was forward advancement of the puck while the offender made (no) contact.

Referee Actions

Potential Penalties

Illegal Advancement (aka Gloving)
Description
Illegal Advancement-Using something other than the players to stick to advance the puck  (eg; glove, extended finger or knuckle, body parts, or other equipment) is considered illegal advancement of the puck.

Common Examples
1.	Handling the puck with the free or playing hand, including guiding the puck with an outstretched finger
2.	If the puck accidentally touches the back of the playing hand, this will not be considered handling the puck unless used deliberately to propel the puck.
3.	 Lifting or carrying the puck balanced on a stick
4.  When the puck is pushed with the glove instead of the stick, since this is the most frequent type of violation for this foul, it is also known as “gloving.”
5.  When a player catches a pass and proceeds to move it forward on the glove instead of getting it on the stick before advancing it
6. When the puck is being battled back and forth at the wall, players get sloppy and start using their gloves instead of their sticks.
7. An out-stretched finger or a pronounced knuckle on the stick hand while advancing the puck on the stick
8.  If the puck is moving in a direction where a stick couldn’t move it without assistance, it’s very likely that the finger is helping.
9.  Kicking the puck into the goal
10. Dragging the puck with a beer belly
11.  Carrying the puck on stick
12. Moving the puck with the free hand.

Referee Actions

Potential Penalties


Illegal Stopping
Description
Illegal Stopping-When a player stops the advancement of the puck by use of anything other than a stick

Common Examples
1.	Stopping or attempting to stop a goal being scored with anything other than the playing area of the stick
2.	 Using hands, arms, or body in any way to grasp, pull, or push an opponent or his/her stick
3.	An offensive player makes a high shot, and a defender tries to intercept it with his stick.  Instead, the puck gets knocked down by the glove.  The defender is at fault for illegal stopping.
4.	A player from either team pushes off the bottom causing his fins to interfere with the play of the puck.
5.	A player laying in the goal or blocking the goal with an arm or a leg

Referee Actions
An offensive player makes a clean high shot, and a defender throws his body in the way so that the puck is stopped with his head.  Is it Dangerous Play by the offender, or Illegal Stopping by the defender?  Because referees see things from different viewpoints, it could be called either way or both.  If the referees saw the scenario differently, they would call a referee time out and discuss the situation and make a call.  For the purpose of this example, the defender would be at fault for illegal stopping, because he made the effort to put himself at risk.

Illegal Stopping is most often accidentally committed; and referees understand that.  This foul mostly gets called when a referee sees that it is affecting the game or is happening quite often.    Here are things to look for:
How are players getting to the surface after making a play?  When a player knocks down a high shot, what made contact with the puck? Is anything being used besides a stick to defend the goal?

Potential Penalties

Stick Infringement
Description
Stick Infringement is any incorrect use of the stick.  The “playing area” is that area of the stick not covered by the player’s hand when the stick is gripped in a natural manner excluding any part of the stick, which extends past the protected little finger
-The stick must be in a gloved hand.
-The stick must be held by the handle of the stick.
-The stick must be used to play against the puck, and not against other sticks, equipment or bodies.

Common Examples
1.	The free hand is supporting the stick, stick hand, or arm whilst in possession of the puck.
2.	The puck being lifted up or carried in any direction whilst balanced on the stick, if not immediately dropped off stick
3.	A player having two hands on the stick when in possession of the puck
4.	However, the puck, while being propelled by the stick, may rest against the index finger when the hand is in its natural position of holding the stick.
5.	Use of the stick, other than to play the puck legally</p>
