    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>If you’re taking this class, chances are you are a serious or at least a semi-serious UWH player or official. You have also probably been to a few tournaments, witnessing a few “bad” calls and tense moments in the pool. You may have been an angry player, a frustrated referee or a flustered new player unsure of what’s happening. No matter your level of playing experience or level of UWH knowledge, learning to referee will benefit the sport of UWH and even your game.</p>
